Sets the Default Zoom level
Just put in any number, typically
the default zoom level is 0.9 for most stages.
I wouldn't recommend going past 1.5
This doesn't go back to normal unless you put in
the number the stage was originally at before.
Just in case you don't know you can find the default Zoom level
in the stages JSON file.
